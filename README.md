q2 Python package
=================

q2 allows you to use MOOG (in its SILENT mode) to calculate elemental abundances of stars and/or determine their atmospheric parameters using the standard techniques of iron line excitation/ionization equlibrium.

Folder Moog contains files that you should replace in your MOOG installation in order to use q2. Copy them into your computer and re-compile MOOG.
